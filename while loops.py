# python has two primitive loop commands 

# 1. while loops 

# 2. for loops 

i = 1   # we named a variable i and assingned it a value
#while i < 6:   # this is a kind of condtition assigned to i with refrence to being lesser than six
   # print(i)  # if we execute this without a further line of code it will gives a result of one infinity times
  #  i +=1 
# +1 will be added to the value i untill it will reach 6
    

# break statement


i = 1
while i < 6 :
    print(i)
    if i ==3:
        break
    i +=1
