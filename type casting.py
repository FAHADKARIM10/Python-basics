a ='fahad'
b='karim'
print(a + b)
# the result of this code will be fahadkarim

ab='1'
ac='2'
print(a + b)
# you might be expecting 3 as a result but that not how it works the result will be 12 beacuse python idle is not 
# aware of the number inside the varible so it will concetinate it 

# the conversion of one  data type in to another data types is know as known as type casting for eg

x = int(1)  #x will be 1
y = int(2.5) #y will be 2
z = int(3) #z will be 3

# some more examples how type casting actually works 

y = float(1) #y will be 1.0
z = float(3) #z will be 3.0


x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
