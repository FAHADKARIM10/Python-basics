# There are three numeric types in Python:

# int             1
# float           1.0
# complex         j1

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

# int or integer is a positive or negative number without a decimal point of unlimited lenght

x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

# float is a positvive or a negative number containing one or more decimals 

x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

# complex numbers are written as j as imaginary part

x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j


# we can also convert data types like 

# to convert int into float 

x =1
a = float(x)
print(type(a))

# this will convet integer into float and will print the data type
